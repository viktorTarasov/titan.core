= Instructions for completing the ICS proforma

== Other information

More detailed instructions are given at the beginning of the different clauses of the ICS proforma.

The supplier of the implementation shall complete the ICS proforma in each of the spaces provided. If necessary, the supplier may provide additional comments separately in Clause A.4.

=== Purposes and structure

The purpose of this ICS proforma is to provide a mechanism whereby a TTCN-3 tool vendor of the link:https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/201800_201899/20187301/04.07.01_60/es_20187301v040701p.pdf[TTCN-3 core language] may provide information about the implementation in a standardized manner.

The ICS proforma is subdivided into clauses for the following categories of information:

* instructions for completing the ICS proforma;
* identification of the implementation;
* ICS proforma tables (containing the global statement of conformance).

=== Conventions

The ICS proforma is composed of information in tabular form in accordance with the guidelines presented in <<_2,ISO/IEC 96467>> .

* Item column

It contains a number that identifies the item in the table.

* Item description column

It describes each respective item (e.g. parameters, timers, etc.).

* Reference column

It gives reference to the  link:https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/201800_201899/20187301/04.07.01_60/es_20187301v040701p.pdf[TTCN-3 core language], except where explicitly stated otherwise.

* Status column

The following notations, defined in <<_2,ISO/IEC 96467>> , are used for the status column:

m:: mandatory - the capability is required to be supported.

n/a:: not applicable - in the given context, it is impossible to use the capability. No answer in the support column is required.

u:: undecided

o:: optional - the capability may be supported or not.

o.i:: qualified optional - for mutually exclusive or selectable options from a set. `i` is an integer which identifies a unique group of related optional items and the logic of their selection which is defined immediately following the table.

ci:: conditional - the requirement on the capability ("m", "o" or "n/a")  depends on the support of other optional or conditional items. `i` is an integer identifying a unique conditional status expression that is defined immediately following the table. For nested conditional expressions, the syntax `IF … THEN (IF … THEN … ELSE…) ELSE …` shall be used to avoid ambiguities. If an `ELSE` clause is omitted, `ELSE n/a` shall be implied.

NOTE: Support of a capability means that the capability is implemented in conformance to the link:https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/201800_201899/20187301/04.07.01_60/es_20187301v040701p.pdf[TTCN-3 core language].

* Support column

The support column shall be filled in by the supplier of the implementation. The following common notations, defined in ISO/IEC 96467 <<_2,[2]>>, are used for the support column:

Y or y supported by the implementation.

N or n not supported by the implementation.

N/A or n/a or "no answer required" (allowed only if the status is N/A, directly or after evaluation of a conditional status).

* Values allowed column

This column contains the values or the ranges of values allowed.

* Values supported column

The support column shall be filled in by the supplier of the implementation. In this column the values or the ranges of values supported by the implementation shall be indicated.

* References to items

For each possible item answer (answer in the support column) within the ICS proforma, a unique reference exists. It is defined as the table identifier, followed by a slash character "/", followed by the item number in the table. If there is more than one support column in a table, the columns shall be discriminated by letters (a, b, etc.) respectively.

EXAMPLE: 5/4 is the reference to the answer of item 4 in Table 5.

== Identification of the implementation

Identification of the Implementation under Test (IUT) and the system in which it resides - the System Under Test (SUT) should be filled in so as to provide as much detail as possible regarding version numbers and configuration options.

The product supplier information and client information should both be filled in if they are different.

A person who can answer queries regarding information supplied in the ICS should be named as the contact person.
