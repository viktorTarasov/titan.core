= About the Document

== Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide detailed information on using the TITAN toolset, that is, creating test suites from TTCN-3, ASN.1 modules, and test port files, by modifying a `Makefile` and using `make` to build executables.

== Target Groups

This document is intended for users of the TITAN TTCN–3 Test Toolset. In addition to this document, readers requiring additional information on creating and building test suites or writing test ports are referred to the link:https://github.com/eclipse/titan.core/tree/master/usrguide/referenceguide[TITAN Programmer's Technical Reference for TITAN TTCN-3 Test Executor].

NOTE: Test port writing requires a sound knowledge of {cpp} programming.
